#There are some type of operator that use in python 
# 1: Arithmetic operators / Mathematicians

# 2:Assignment operators

# 3:Comparison operators

# 4:Logical operators

# 5:Membership operators

# 1:
# print(1+5) # add
# print(3-5) # subtact
# print(5*6) #multiple
# print(18/3)#  divided and give float number 
# print(13%4) # to find remaind after divived // an other name As Modulus
# print(56//2) # to get answer int
# print(2**4) # power or exponment

# PEMDAS (Paraenthesis, Exponement ,Multiple,Divived,Additioon,Subtract) or Operator Precedence
print((3*4/4+5-2)/(3*3))
# ANother Example
print(2**6*5/50+10-10)

# 2:
x = 10   # assignment is used here for giving value to the variable x
print(x)
x += 20 # Add value in x variable
print(x)
x -= 7  # Subtract from x variable
print(x)
x *= 9  # Multiply with x variable
print(x)
y = 10
y /= 5  # division and assign the resultant value to y
print(y)
z = "Hello"
z += " World"
print(z)
# 3: Comparison operators
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
if num1 == num2 :
    print("Both numbers are equal")
elif num1 < num2 :
    print("First Number is smaller than Second Number")
print(num1>=num2)
print(num1==num2)
print(num1<num1)
print(num1!=num2)
# Logical operators AND OR NOT
print(True and True)
print(False and False)
print(True or False)
print(not True)

# In python there three type of logical operator
# 1 And operator
# 2 OR  operator
# 3 Not operator
x = 9
print(x < 5 and  x < 10)
print(x < 5 or x < 10)
print(not(x < 5 or x < 10))

#Membership Operators 
var1 = "Python for Beginners"
print("f" in var1)
var2 = ["orange", 5, "3.5"]
print(5 in var2)
