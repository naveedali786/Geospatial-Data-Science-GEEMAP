#Q. Why we need Comment in code?
#Define  the each line which pupose for wrting of code
#That help the other programmer to understand codes
# To define the logical behind use or specfice method use 



#Some Example case Here

# Step 1: Why to use single quotation ?
print('Hello Programmer! ,How are you')# When we are wrting a strings

#Step 2: When to use double quotation marks

print("Hello Programmer! ,i am writing Double Quotation String")# when wrting srting and  marking of other quotation mark

# Step 3: When to use tripple quotation marks?
print('''
      Hello My namee  is Naveed
      I belong to mianwali
      i have done fsc pre engineering
      Now i get admssion in Bs geo informatics''') # When we need to use 
# mutiple line as string and also using single or double  quotation inside  string


print("This is String") # I am writing a string
print(4+4) # i adding two number
