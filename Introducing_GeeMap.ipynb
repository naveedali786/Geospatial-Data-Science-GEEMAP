It allows users to display, modify, and **analyze** geospatial data **quickly** and **effectively** to its features a **multi-petabyte data** repository of **satellite images and geographic datasets**. **Geemap** greatly simplifies the analysis and visualization of Earth Engine datasets in a **Jupyter environment**. It is based on the Earth Engine **Python API** and **open-source mapping tools**. Ever since its launch in April 2020, geemap has grown to be the most widely used Python tool for interactive **Earth Engine data analysis** and display.Special thanks to [Dr. Qiusheng Wu](https://dot.cards/giswqs) for sharing such nice geospatial packages, Geemap and Leafmap, for **geospatial communities**."
